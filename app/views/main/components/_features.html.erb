          <h2>How can I make my recordings accessible?</h2>
          <p>In the webinterface, you have three options for publishing recordings via a drop-down menu:</p> 
          <p><i class="fas fa-user-shield"></i><b> Private:</b> This is the default setting, and also set for the recording you currently try to access. The recording exists, but you cannot access it via the Internet.</p> 
          <p><i class="fas fa-link"></i><b> Unlisted:</b> With this setting, you can access the recording (via the link that now brought you to this site). Everyone with the link can watch the recording, until you set it back to private.</p> 
          <p><i class="fas fa-globe"></i><b> Public:</b> With this setting, the recording will <em>also</em> be listed on the public start-page of your online meeting room. Convenient, if you want to make several lecture recordings publicly accessible to your students.</p>
